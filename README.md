# Job-Openings-and-Labor-Turnover-2021
A statistical analysis using vizualization tools of the Job openings and hires discrepancy in the Fall of 2021 as it reached record peaks. This will follow several literature reviews and the possible variables affecting it will also be analyzed statistically. 

The data was taken from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data pulled was seasonally adjusted values in hundred thousands for total non farm Job Openings, Hires, and Quits. Total Nonfarm, commonly known as Total Nonfarm Payroll, is a measure of the number of U.S. workers in the economy that excludes proprietors, private household employees, unpaid volunteers, farm employees, and the unincorporated self-employed. This measure accounts for approximately 80 percent of the workers who contribute to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
Seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique that attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns to reveal how employment and unemployment change from month to month.

This data was first cleaned and organized to only focus on 2019-2021 data to then hyperfocus on 2020-2021, the covid pandemic era. The entries are monthly and end on September 2021. 

The following are the most reflective graphs:
